        <p>
            I believe my strongest trait is my continued interest in learning. And no this is not just in an academic sense. I like to learn about my interests, such as animals and music, and have found many informal avenues to do so. This has led to me building a catalogue of information, resources, and research skill that help my in my academic journey. It has also helped me to become a better problem solver. Whenever I run into an issue, I know I can search for the answers somewhere out there in places that some people may not even look and come up with solutions faster.

                If I absolutely had to choose a hero, it would be the character Horatio Caine from the television series CSI: MIAMI. Lieutenant Horatio Caine is the day shift supervisor and head of the Miami-Dade Crime Lab. As a crime scene investigator, he is constantly trying to find culprits in various cases. I am a fan of Lieutenant Caine as he is a hardworking man with a strong sense of justice. He never leaves the little people out and strives to uncover the truth.

                <h2 align="center">My Thoughts on Personality Types</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
                Throughout my life I have had a few opportunities to hear about personality tests and take a few of them too. I believe that there is some validity to personality types, but that they are not set in stone nor are they something to hold too tightly to. <br />
                From personal experience, I know that personality types often times, though not always, give accurate representations of your habits, likes and dislikes. Therefore, I do not think you should use them as law. Be aware yes, but do not feel as though you must do the same things or be the same as whatever you saw or read about your personality type. <br />
                I also believe that personality types are not set in stone. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator has multiple personality types because it tests different factors on a range. This means that you can score highly in one area, low in another and mid somewhere else. It also means that as a person grows and changes their results may change too. For a long time I would get the result INTP, this has been my result even when I retake the test. However, my most recent round of the test said I was an ISTP and I am satisfied with that result. I have changed as I have gotten older and have started to take new approaches to my work. Ultimately, I think it is a useful tool as a starting point to understanding oneself and others. <br />

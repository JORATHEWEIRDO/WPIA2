        <h3><a name="Chap4" href="">Chapter 4</a>:</h3>
        <p>
            Chapter four like its title covers achieving your goals. The chapter delves into goals and gives you useful advice on identifying, setting, and ultimately achieving goals. I have learnt that a goal determines the trajectory of one’s life and without a goal you can start to feel as if you are not going anywhere or living up to your potential. I identify with feeling as if I’m not going anywhere, at least sometimes and agree that goal setting is important. To identify a goal, I must dream of something I would like to achieve in five or ten years. Then break it down into a smaller goal to achieve in half that time, followed by a smaller goal to achieve in less time. These long-range, mid-range and short-range goals are the building blocks that will lead to my final goal. It seems simple to do, chose something achievable, write it down and break it down into smaller increments. This is how I can achieve my goals.
        </p>

        <h3><a name="Chap5" href="">Chapter 5</a>:</h3>
        <p>
            Chapter five covers the proper use of one’s time. I have learnt that we all have only so many hours each day and a day is only spent well when it is spent the best way possible. The best way possible according to the book is when we do things that align with our overall goals in life. For me, as someone who wants to someday become an animated film director, the best way possible is building my portfolio and learning more about management and the field of animation. I must have discipline, least I come to regret my life choices on my deathbed.
        </p>

        <h3><a name="Chap6" href="">Chapter 6</a>:</h3>
        <p>
            Chapter six covers the idea of surrounding oneself with the best people. In this chapter I read that the people in our lives influence the decisions that we make. This means that it is important to have people who want the same things as you in life, successful people, and winners so that you may be encouraged to grow and develop. Letting go of relationships that you may have had for a long time is often difficult. However, if these relationships do not add value to your life or do not have a positive effect on you then you should consider some distance. These ideas are not something that I am unfamiliar with, however I did learn about three categories of association: disassociation, limited association, and expanded association. One must constantly evaluate their relationships and place them in these categories to be surrounded by the right people. It is important to note however, that one must also strive to be the kind of person that they would like to surround themselves with. I have and will continue to evaluate my relationships with others.
        </p>

        <h3><a name="Chap7" href="">Chapter 7</a>:</h3>
        <p>
            Chapter seven speaks to being a life-long learner. In this chapter I learnt the importance of self-education. Through constantly learning and expanding one’s knowledge you can improve and grow. Some methods include reading, observing successful people and constantly reflecting on your own life with the aim of learning what went right and what went wrong. Books are the most common and reliable method as they are a collect ion of information waiting to be explored. I would consider myself a lifelong learner, after all I have always been interested in learning about all sorts of topics ranging from animals to music to cinematography. This reading has encouraged me to keep going and to be a little more intentional about the topics I choose invest my time in.

            Skills I've Aquired During My Degree
        </h2>

            <p class="maintext-orange">
             I am currently pursing a degree in the BSC.Animation Production and Development program at University of Technology, Jamaica. Over the years I have learnt many skills but here are just a few.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>3D Modeling</h3>
        <p>
            I learnt 3D modeling during a course of the same name in my second semester of third year. I had been wanting to learn for a while and was exicited for the chance. It turns out that it was just as fun as I wanted it to be.
            During the time that I was learning, I spent hours researching and practicing different ways that it could be done.
            Well, it all worked out and earned me a recommendation to work with Sagicors Innovation Lab where I was able to experience app development, coding and working in a tech environment.
        </p>

        <h3>Attention to Detail</h3>
        <p>
            During my degree program I have had many assignments where I must analyze movement, scenes, people and actions.
            Through these exercies I have sharpened my skills in observation.
        </p>

        <h3>Storytelling/ Story Structure</h3>
        <p>
            I have always been a creative individual with many ideas.
            The many writting classes I am now better able to put my thoughts in order and turn my ideas into stories.
